#### CCC '19 J1 - Winning Score
You record all of the scoring activity at a basketball game. Points are scored by a 3-point shot, a 2-point field goal, or a 1-point free throw.
You know the number of each of these types of scoring for the two teams: the Apples and the Bananas. 
Your job is to determine which team won, or if the game ended in a tie.
